# 🧠 Quantum Computing & Shor's Algorithm — 2110404 Computational Theory

This repository contains the **report** and **slide presentation** for a final project in the course **2110404 Computational Theory** at the **Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University**.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project walks through the complete journey from the **foundations of quantum computing** to the **quantum algorithm that breaks RSA encryption**: **Shor's Algorithm**. The material is structured to build understanding progressively, covering both quantum and classical theory.

### 🔹 Topics Covered

1. **Quantum Computing Basics**
   - Qubits and superposition
   - Quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, phase)
   - Measurement and entanglement

2. **Quantum Algorithms**
   - Phase kickback
   - Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
   - Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

3. **RSA Encryption**
   - Key generation
   - Encryption and decryption
   - Security assumptions based on factoring

4. **Number Theory & Classical Reduction**
   - Reducing integer factorization to period finding
   - Modular exponentiation and Euler's totient
   - Using order to break RSA

5. **Shor’s Algorithm**
   - Circuit structure and each quantum step explained
   - Measurement and classical post-processing
   - How the quantum subroutine finds the period efficiently

6. **Time Complexity Comparison**
   - Classical methods (e.g., General Number Field Sieve): sub-exponential
   - Shor’s algorithm: polynomial time
